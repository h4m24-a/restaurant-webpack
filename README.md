Restaurant page built using JavaScript and Webpack

## View the project : https://h4m24-a.github.io/restaurant-webpack/

It's a simple project and design as I focused on learning and using Webpack with Javascript.

 - DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage.
 - The content on each page is generated with JavaScript alone.
